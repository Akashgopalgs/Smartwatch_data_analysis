# Smartwatch_data_analysis

**Overview**

SmartWatch Data Analysis Using Python: 



There is a lot of competition among the brands in the smartwatch industry. Smartwatches are preferred by people who like to take care of their fitness. Here I gave a CSV file containing the fitness details of people.

1. Data Source : CSV File
2. Notebook : Google Colab
3. Data Visualization :Plotly , Seaborn


**Data Cleaning:**

Clean Data

**Data Wrangling**

No data wrangling performed


**Analysis**

The analysis provides valuable insights into the activity patterns and caloric expenditure of individuals based on smartwatch data. The clear identification of most and least active days enhances our understanding of the factors influencing physical activity.cleaned data using pandas and visualize using seaborn and matplotlib


**Visualization**

Using Seaborn and plotly visualize the cleaned data 


**Conclusion**

According to the analysis of calories burned, the most active days for all individuals in the dataset are Tuesdays, while the least active day is Sunday. This conclusion is drawn by considering the days where individuals burned the most calories as the most active and the days with the least sedentary minutes as the least active.
